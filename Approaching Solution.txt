We approached this problem by first identifying the core pain point faced by travelers: decision fatigue caused by an overload of generic options and the absence of guidance tailored to individual needs. Rather than building another static tourism listing platform, we treated trip planning as a decision-making problem. The focus was on building a system that evaluates context and intent before making recommendations.

The first step was to simplify user input while still capturing meaningful intent. The user provides only essential signals such as mood, budget range, trip duration, and group type. Internally, these inputs are transformed into structured parameters that allow the system to understand why the user wants to travel, not just where they want to go.

Once user intent is captured, destinations and activities pass through a relevance-filtering layer. Instead of displaying popular places by default, each option is evaluated against constraints such as available time, budget feasibility, and seasonal suitability. This early filtering reduces noise and ensures that only realistic and actionable options are considered. To maintain speed and reliability in a hackathon setting, we intentionally avoided heavy machine learning at this stage.

After filtering, the remaining options are ranked using a multi-factor scoring approach. Each destination or activity is scored based on its alignment with the user’s mood, budget, trip duration, and travel overhead. This scoring-based system provides transparency, flexibility, and rapid iteration, which are critical when building under tight time constraints.

Using the ranked results, the system generates a day-wise itinerary. Itinerary generation is treated as a constraint-based planning problem, where locations are arranged based on proximity, estimated travel time, daily limits, and rest intervals. The objective is not theoretical optimization but creating a practical and realistic plan that users can easily follow.

To enhance adaptability, the system incorporates real-time signals such as weather conditions and peak crowd periods wherever available. These signals are used to make small but impactful adjustments, such as preferring indoor activities during unfavorable weather or suggesting off-peak visit timings, without adding unnecessary architectural complexity.

Finally, the user experience emphasizes clarity and trust. The platform explains recommendations in simple terms, such as why a destination was selected or why an activity was scheduled on a specific day. This avoids a black-box experience and builds user confidence. Overall, the approach balances intelligence, speed, and practicality, making it well-suited for delivering a meaningful and functional solution within a real-time hackathon environment.
